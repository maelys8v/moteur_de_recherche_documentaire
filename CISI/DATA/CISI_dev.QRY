Cocited Author Retrieval Online:
An Experiment with the Social Indicators Literature
.A
White, H.D.
.W
    One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involves
entering pairs of authors' names believed to be jointly cited by
subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six
pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social
indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the
four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land
would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with
path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a
"general social indicators" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed
expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators
(SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in
their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of
the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally
cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic
in nature.  As expected, they were relatively "harder" than the first
group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked
through citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papers
citing at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SI
movement.

A Comparison of Two Systems of Weighted Boolean Retrieval
.A
Bookstein, A.
.W
    A major deficiency of traditional Boolean systems is their inability to
represent the varying degrees to which a document may be written on a subject.
In this article we isolate a number of criteria that should be met by any
Boolean system generalized to have a weighting capability.  It is proven that
only one weighting rule satisfies these conditions--that associated with fuzzy-
set theory--and that this weighting scheme satisfies most of the other
properties associated with Boolean algebra as well.  Probabilistic weighting
is then introduced as an alternative approach and the two systems compared.
In the limit of zero/one weights, all systems considered converge to
traditional Boolean retrieval.

Brief Communications
.A
Harding, A.G.
Willett, P.
.W
    Some of the automatic classification procedures used in information
retrieval derive clusters of documents from an intermediate similarity
matrix, the computation of which involves comparing each of the documents
in the collection with all of the others.  It has recently been suggested
that many of these comparisons, specifically those between documents
having no terms in common, may be avoided by means of the uyse of an inverted
file to the document collection.  This communication shows that the
approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisons
only if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexing
terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be compared
several times over and the computation will be greater than when
conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.

The Measurement of Term Importance in Automatic Indexing
.A
Salton, G.
Wu, H.
Yu, C.T.
.W
    The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collection
have been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis and
indexing purposes.  In particular, very rare or very frequent terms are
normally believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms.  Recently
automatic indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term
frequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms.
The major term-weighting theories are first briefly reviewed.  The term
precision and term utility weights that are based on the occurrence
characteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant,
documents of a collection are then introduced.  Methods are suggested for
estimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their overall
occurrence characteristics in the collection.  Finally, experimental
evaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the term
relevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies.

Library Networks and Resource Sharing in the United States:
An Historical and Philosophical Overview

Stevens, N.D.
.W
    This paper discusses the origins of library networks and traces their
development in the United States in the late 1960s through the present.
The concept of resource sharing, with particular attention to the inter-
library loan and programs for the cooperative acquisition and storage of
materials, is examined in relationship to library networks.  In particular,
attention is given to the question of how these two major components of
library cooperation, which have tended to be separate, might become more
closely integrated.

The Use of Automatic Relevance Feedback in Boolean Retrieval Systems
.A
Dillon, M.
Desper, J.
.W
    A technique is described for automatic reformulation of boolean
queries.  Based on patron relevance judgements of an initial retrieval,
prevalence measures are derived for terms appearing in the retrieved set
of documents that reflect a term's distribution among the relevant and
non-relevant documents.  These measures are then used to guide the
construction of a boolean query for a subsequent retrieval.  To illustrate
the technique, a series of tests is described of its application to a small
data base in an experimental environment.  Results compare favourably with
feedback as employed in a SMART-type system.  MOre extensive testing is
suggested to validate the technique.

The Use of Titles for Automatic Document Classification
.A
Hamill, K.A.
Zamora, A.
.W
    An experimental computer program has been developed to classify
documents according to the 80 sections and five major section groupings of
Chemical Abstracts (CA).  The program uses pattern recognition techniques
supplemented by heuristics.  During the "training" phase, words from
pre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrence
of each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a reference
dictionary.  The "classification" phase matches each word of a document
title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document
using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristic
techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past
tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification
phase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of
chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence
the section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance and
human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results
against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with
people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.  The
program assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct major
section groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross-references
at a rate of 100 documents per second.

Author Cocitation:  A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure
.A
White, H.D.
Griffith, B.C.
.W
    It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this
case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and
the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their
"distances" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authors
are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data
are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences
Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows
(1) identifiable author groups (akin to "schools") of information science,
(2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of
centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of
authors within group and across group boundaries ("border authors" who seem
to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with
respect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most
divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of
authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of
intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the
extent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The technique
establishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit in
analyzing subject specialties.

A General Formulation of Bradford's Distribution:  The Graph-Oriented
Approach
.A
Asai, I.
.W
    From the detailed analysis of eight previously published mathematical
models, a general formulation of Bradford's distribution can be deduced as
follows:  y = a log(x + c) + b, where y is the ratio of the cumulative
frequency of articles to the total number of articles and x is the ratio
of the rank of journals to the total number of journals.  The parameters a, b,
and c are the slope, the intercept, and the shift in a straight line to log rank,
respectively.  Each of the eight models is a special case of the general
formulation and is one of five types of formulation.  In order to estimate
three unknown parameters, a statistical method using root-weighted square
error is proposed.  A comparative experiment using 11 databases suggests that
the fifth type of formulation with three unknown parameters is the best fit
to the observed data.  A further experiment shows that the deletion of the
droop data leads to a more accurate value of parameters and less error.

Lexical Problems in Large Distributed Information Systems
.A
Berkovich, S.Y.
Shneiderman, B.
.W
    The lexical problems in large information systems are created by the
necessity of handling a great number of names and their interrelations.
Such lexical problems are not covered completely by the concept data
dictionaries, which are mostly concerned with database scheme design rather
than the execution of operations.  In this paper we introduce our view of a
lexical subsystem as a separate component in an information system architecture,
to deal with linguistic and control functions concerning the lexical problems
in local and network environments.  The lexical suybsystem is a special
efficiently organized program package, which plays the role of a "linguistic
filter" in a broad sense for lexically incorrect queries, promotes integration
of databases and information retrieval systems, and facilitates the creation
of local information systems.  We hope that lexical subsystems can become
productive for any large, especially distributed, information system.

Partial-Match Retrieval Using Indexed Descriptor Files

Pfaltz, J.L.

.W
    In this paper we describe a practical method of partial-match retrieval
in very large data files.  A binary code word, called a descriptor, is
associated with each record of the file.  These record descriptors are
then used to form a derived descriptor for a block of several records,
which will serve as an index for the block as a whole; hence, the name
"indexed descriptor files."

    First the structure of these files is described and a simple, efficient
retrieval algorithm is presented.  Then its expected behavior, in terms of
storage accesses, is analyzed in detail.  Two different file creation
procedures are sketched, and a number of ways in which the file organization
can be "tuned" to a particular application is suggested.

Fuzzy Requests:  An Approach to Weighted Boolean Searches

    This article concerns the problem of how to permit a patron to
represent the relative importance of various index terms in a Boolean
request while retaining the desirable properties of a Boolean system.
The character of classical Boolean systems is reviewed and related to the
notion of fuzzy sets.  The fuzzy set concept then forms the basis of the
concept of a fuzzy request in which weights are assigned to index terms.
Ther properties of such a system are discussed, and it is shown that such
systems retain the manipulability of traditional Boolean requests.

An Automatic Method for Extracting Significant

    A new method is described to extract significant phrases in the title
and the abstreact of scientific or technical documents.  The method is
based upon a text structure analysis and uses a relatively small dictionary.
The dictionary has been constructed based on the knowledge about concepts
in the field of science or technology and some lexical knowledge.  For
significant phrases and their component items may be used in different
meanings among the fields.  A text analysius approach has been applied to
select significant phrases as substantial and semantic information carriers
of the contents of the abstract.

    The results of the experiment for five sets of documents have shown
that the significant phrases are effectively extracted in all cases, and
the number of them for every document and the processing time is fairly
satisfactory.  The information representation of the document, partly
using the method, is discussed with relation to the construction of the
document information retrieval system.
