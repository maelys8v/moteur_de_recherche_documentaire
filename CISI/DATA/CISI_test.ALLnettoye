18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications   The present study is a history of the DEWEY DecimalClassification.  The first edition of the DDC was publishedin 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editionswill continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC'slong and healthy life, however, its full story has neverbeen told.  There have been biographies of Deweythat briefly describe his system, but this is the firstattempt to provide a detailed history of the work thatmore than any other has spurred the growth oflibrarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical LibrariesThis report is an analysis of 6300 acts of usein 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern ofinformation use.  Information transfer in libraries isrestricted to the use of documents.  It takes noaccount of documents used outside the library, stillless of information transferred orally from personto person.  The library acts as a channel in only aproportion of the situations in which information istransferred.Taking technical information transfer as a whole,there is no doubt that this proportion is not themajor one.  There are users of technical information -particularly in technology rather than science -who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on deskcollections of handbooks, current periodicals and personalcontact with their colleagues and with people in otherorganizations.  Even regular library users also receiveinformation in other ways.

Two Kinds of PowerAn Essay on Bibliographic Control    The relationships between the organization and control of writingsand the organization and control of knowledge and information willinevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, agreat deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographicalcontrol is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sensepower over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in writtenform.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses ofknowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control assimply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

Systems Analysis of a University Library; final report and research project    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academiclibraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, butalthough changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objectiveinformation about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which,in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research intoall aspects of academic library provision.

A Library Management Game:a report on a research project    Although the use of games in professional education hasbecome widespread only during the last decade, the method hasbeen used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used inmilitary training when the "real thing" was either unavailableor too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games havebecome more and more sophisticated, and many now use largeelectronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game wasintroduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide varietyof disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,from primary school classes to courses for experienced professionalmen and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"has been the rapid development of sophisticated managementtechniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, whichhave been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course.It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishingindustry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in thepreparation and evaluation of the product.These topics we call concepts.     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writingvarious types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in theappendix.There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for webelieve that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in thepast.Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation ofcomputer-prepared abstracts and extracts.Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about thisresearch and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.The benefits of this research are discussed.    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time orvolunteer workers.Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they knowthey are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

Academic Library BuildingsA Guide to Architectural Issues and SolutionsThis book attempts to present representative examples of successfularchitectural solutions to the important problems librarians andarchitects face in planning new college and university librarybuildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It doesnot attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done byEllsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examplesof unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes,and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.

The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle     As important for staff members' individual developmentas was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the mostsignificant attitude one acquired while working forGuy was engendered by his insistence that librarians mustbe interested in and knowledgeable about the content of thematerials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, hisrespect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing andreading were manifested in many ways, but most notably inhis admonition that, though we were primarily a researchlibrary, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation tocollect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  Itwas primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to beresponsible for these as well as for "general" books which crosseddisciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those bookswhich a faculty mostly concerned with research materials isapt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance withbooks through a reading of critical reviews and the booksthemselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--theneed to keep up with the world of books and publishing--wascontinually impressed upon us.

Access to Libraries in College     This study assumed that an additional use study heldless promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional andcurrent professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gatheringinstruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approachand browsing left the problems largely unresolved andevidently resistant to established methods of use and userresearch.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts wasconfirmed.     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classificationand relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,social, and political interest of the average citizen and affecthis democratic self-realization.     Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgenceby the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-educationfor the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in hisresearch.
